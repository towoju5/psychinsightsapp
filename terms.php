            <br><br></span><span class="">This Section of this Agreement Shall be Referred to as the &quot;Arbitration Agreement.&quot;
            <br><br>1. By accepting the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and the Company
            (collectively, &quot;Parties&quot;) agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those
            <br><br>specifically exempted below) arising out of or relating to
            <br><br></span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="">this Agreement and subsequent versions of this Agreement, or concerning
                the existence, applicability, breach, termination, enforcement,
                interpretation, scope, waiver, or validity thereof; and
            </li>
            <li>the use of the Platform or Therapist Services (collectively, &quot;Disputes&quot;) will
              be resolved on an individual basis by final and binding arbitration,
              regardless of its date of accrual. Except as it otherwise provides, this
              Arbitration Agreement is intended to apply to the resolution of Disputes
              that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other
              than arbitration. All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes
              of limitation that would apply in court. By accepting the terms of this
              Arbitration Agreement, you and the Company mutually agree to waive
              their respective rights to trial by jury.
              The Parties recognize that the Agreement involves transactions spanning across state
              boundaries and agree that all matters pertaining to arbitration or the enforce-ability of
              this Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Act
              applicable in the relevant Australian jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be facilitated by
              the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (&quot;ACICA&quot;) under its
              Commercial Arbitration Rules (&quot;ACICA Arbitration Rules&quot;), which are accessible online at
              www.acica.org.au or by utilizing a service such as Google to search for &quot;ACICA
              Commercial Arbitration Rules&quot;. Nevertheless, in the event of a discrepancy between the
              ACICA Arbitration Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the stipulations outlined in this
              Arbitration Agreement shall prevail. The following terms and procedures shall apply:
            </li>
            <li>The arbitration shall be heard by one arbitrator selected in accordance
              with the ACICA Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator shall be a member of the
              bar of the state in which the arbitration will be conducted or a retired judge
              from any jurisdiction and, in either case, shall have experience in the law
              underlying the dispute.

            </li>
            <li>Other than issues related to the Class Action Waiver (as defined below), the
              arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have
              exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the
              interpretation, applicability, enforce-ability or formation of this Arbitration
              Agreement, any part of it, or of the Agreement including, but not limited to,
              any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement or Agreement
              is void or voidable.
            </li>
            <li>If the parties cannot otherwise agree on a location for the arbitration, the
              arbitration shall take place in Canberra, Australia.
            </li>
            <li>Each party will pay the fees for its own attorneys, subject to any remedies
              to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. In all cases
              where required by law, the Company will pay the arbitrator's and
              arbitration fees. If under applicable law the Company is not required to pay
              all of the arbitrator's and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be
              apportioned between the Parties in accordance with said applicable law.
              Any disputes regarding whether the Company is required to pay the
              arbitrator’s and arbitration fees and/or how those fees are to be
              apportioned between the Parties will be resolved by the arbitrator.
            </li>
            <li>The arbitrator shall issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties for
              pre-hearing discovery) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient
              to allow each party to prepare its claims and/or defenses, taking into
              consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient
              method for resolving disputes.
            </li>
            <li>Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver (as defined below), the
              arbitrator may award all remedies to which a party is entitled under
              applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law,
              but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have
              been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration. The
              arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is
              applicable.
            </li>
            <li>Either party shall be permitted to file a motion to dismiss and/or motion
              for summary judgment, and the arbitrator will apply the standards of the
              Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 governing such motions.
            </li>
            <li>The arbitrator's decision or award shall be in writing with findings of fact
              and conclusions of law. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's
              decision or award in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or
              preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy
              in accordance with applicable law, and any such application shall not be
              deemed incompatible with or waiver of this Arbitration Agreement. The
              court to which the application is made is authorized to consider the merits
              of the arbitrable controversy to the extent it deems necessary in making its
              ruling, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law. </span></li>
          </ul><span class="">All
            determinations of final relief, however, will be decided in arbitration.
            If for any reason the ACICA will not administer the arbitration, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration
            will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Arbitration Agreement. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration.
            <br><br>2. Class, Collective, and Other Representative Action Waivers (&quot;Class Action
            Waiver&quot;). You and the Company mutually agree that by entering into this
            Arbitration Agreement, both waive their right to have any dispute, claim, or
            controversy brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, and/or other
            representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law, and an arbitrator
            will not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any such class, collective, or other
            representative action. You also waive your right to receive notice of any class,
            collective, or other representative action that may be filed. Notwithstanding any
            other clause contained in this Arbitration Agreement or the ACICA Arbitration
            Rules, as defined above and incorporated herein by reference, any claim that all or
            part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable
            may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
            arbitrator. In any case in which:
            <br><br></span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="">the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or other representative action; and
            </li>
            <li>there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action
              </span></li>
          </ul><span class="">Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective, or other representative
            action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent
            jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable
            shall be enforced in arbitration.
            <br><br>3. Mass Arbitration. To the extent permitted by applicable law, to increase efficiency
            of resolution, in the event 25 or more arbitration demands of a similar nature are
            <br><br>filed against the Company, presented by or with the assistance or involvement of
            the same law firm or organization, the Parties agree that this will constitute a
            <br><br>&quot;Mass Arbitration&quot; and the following terms and procedures shall apply:
            <br><br></span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="">The Parties shall cooperate to group the arbitration demands into
                randomized batches of no more than 100 demands per batch. To the extent
                there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching
                previously described, a final batch shall consist of the remaining demands.
            </li>
            <li>Claimants’ counsel shall organize and present the batched demands to the
              arbitration provider in a format as directed by the arbitration provider.
            </li>
            <li>The arbitration provider shall treat each batch of demands as one case,
              with each case having one demand for arbitration, one appointed
              arbitrator, and one set of administrative documents, and administrative
              and filing fees per batch.
            </li>
            <li>A separate arbitrator will be appointed to, and administrative and filing
              fees assessed for, each batch of demands.
              </span></li>
          </ul><span class="">The Parties agree that arbitration demands are of a &quot;similar nature&quot; if they arise out of or
            relate to a similar factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the
            same or similar relief. You agree to cooperate in good faith with the Company and the
            arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach to resolution and fees.
            Disagreements over the applicability of this batch arbitration process will be settled in a
            single, consolidated arbitration proceeding that includes all affected parties and is
            resolved by a single arbitrator subject to the requirements of this section.
            <br><br>Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, batch arbitrations shall
            take place in Canberra, Australia.
            <br><br>4. Exceptions to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following claims:
            <br><br></span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="">individual claims brought in small claims court so long as the matter
                remains in such court and advances only on an individual basis;
            </li>
            <li>individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in
              connection with your use of the Platform; and/or
            </li>
            <li>injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
              prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
              violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or
              other intellectual property rights. </span></li>
          </ul><span class="">Also, this Arbitration Agreement does
            not apply to disputes that may not be subject to arbitration as expressly
            provided by a controlling federal or state statute. Disputes between the
            parties that may not be subject to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, as
            provided by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act of
            2001, or any other relevant provisions established under Australian law,
            are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Agreement. This
            exclusion is also applicable to any restrictions placed by an Act of the
            Australian Parliament.

            <br><br>5. Optional Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Before initiating
            arbitration, you and the Company may first attempt to resolve any Disputes
            informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by the Parties.
            <br><br>The informal negotiations begin upon receipt of written notice from one party to
            the other (&quot;Notice of Dispute&quot;). The Notice of Dispute must:
            <br><br></span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="">include the full name and contact information of the complaining party;
            </li>
            <li>describe the nature and basis of the dispute, claim, or controversy; and
            </li>
            <li>set forth the specific relief sought. </span></li>
          </ul><span class="">The Company will send its Notice of
            Dispute to your billing or email address. You will send your Notice of
            Dispute to: the company address as contained in the contact us section of
            this web platform. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether
            oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the Parties,
            their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and
            inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for
            impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
            provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall
            not be rendered inadmissible as a result of its use in the negotiation.
            <br><br>6. Application to Third Parties. This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon,
            and shall include any claims brought by or against any third parties, including but
            not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries and assigns, where
            their underlying claim(s) arise out of or relate to your use of the Platform or
            Therapist Services. To the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this
            Agreement brings claims against the Parties, those claims shall also be subject to
            this Arbitration Agreement.

            <br><br>7. Right to Opt Out of Arbitration. You may opt out from this Arbitration Agreement
            within 30 days after you first access or use the Platform by sending written notice

            Agreement and Class Action Waiver. Should you not opt out of this Arbitration

            of the Parties' relationship.
