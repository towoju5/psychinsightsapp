          Our goal is to align with the rigorous standards set by the Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AA. To ensure we're on the
          right path, we're adopting best practices as outlined by WebAIM's WCAG 2
          checklist.

          For an optimal experience, we suggest using the most recent versions of
          assistive technology applications and web browsers. Our website has been
          designed to be flexible to your personal preferences. You can utilize the
          built-in controls of your browser or additional extensions to tailor the
          content presentation to your needs, be it enlarging text or adjusting text
          contrast. Using an updated browser will provide the broadest array of
          accessibility features.

        <div class="text-black text-2xl w-full mt-2.5 max-md:max-w-full">
          It's worth noting that our platform may feature content from third-party
          providers. Although we don't have direct influence over third-party content,
          we ardently advocate for these vendors to uphold the same high standards of
          accessibility and user-friendliness that we strive for.

          functionalities aren't wholly accessible for differently-abled individuals,
