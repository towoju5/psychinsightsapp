		'message' => "I am writing to provide a character reference for Sam Frerer. I have had the privilege of working with Sam in my role as Head of Department, Mental Health Team, for the Australian Defence Force in Canberra. As a senior supervising psychologist, I have had direct experience with Sam’s clinical skills as a psychologist as we work with the same client base - ADF members. <br>

		Sam consistently demonstrates a very high standard of the core competencies a psychologist should have who works to treat highly complex psychological disorders. Her professional practise framework, ethics, morals and integrity are exceptional as a psychologist. She is masterful in working across many psychology domains. Sam’s approach to treatment embodies a therapeutic style that fosters respect, mutual rapport, and she has an exemplary success rate of positive outcomes with her clients - many of whom have highly complex presentations. <br>
		
		Meticulous with organisational skills, she is also a psychologist who is adaptable and easily able to provide a safe and nurturing environment that builds trust and allows for even the most challenging of practitioner/client barriers to be broken down in order to facilitate positive engagement in therapy. <br>
		
		Sam does this utilising an empathetic and non judgmental approach combined with superb active listening skills. In sum, there is no doubt that Sam possesses in depth knowledge of a broad range of evidence based therapeutic approaches to psychology. She tailors her treatment plans to each individual, therefore ensuring best practise for every client to maximise successful treatment goals.<br>
		
		Sam also diligently stays well informed with research and continuing professional development to ensure she is always providing a gold standard of treatment to all her clients. I am well aware of many ADF clients that Sam has treated that were complex, but had highly successful outcomes in symptom reduction, which has not only changed lives, but, undoubtedly, also saved lives. I cannot recommend her more highly as an experienced, compassionate and skilled senior psychologist. She is a delight to work with as a colleague also.
