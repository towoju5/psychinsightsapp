                For individuals who participate in a Pyschinsights Family plan, we may collect additional personal data,

                processor collects Payment Card data with respect to purchases made through the Websites. Such payment
                processors generally provide us with some limited data related to you, such as a unique, anonymous token
                that enables you to make additional purchases using the data they’ve stored, and your card’s type,

              Pyschinsights and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to
              enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same data several times during
              one task, to recognize that you may have already given a username and password so you don't need to do it
              for every web page requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.
              <br>
              We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content data and preferences. Third parties with whom we
              partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store data. Various
              browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

              We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on
              other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our Website.
              Our

              We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by “clicking-through”

              As you may know, a European Union law called the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) gives certain
              rights to applicable individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have implemented
              transparency and access controls to help such users, including residents of the EU, Switzerland, and the
              United Kingdom exercise those rights. As required under applicable law, the rights afforded to you are: A
              right of access: you have the right to obtain (i) confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you
              are processed or not and, if processed, to obtain (ii) access to such data and a copy thereof. We provide
              an
              easy-to-view snapshot of such data via the “My Data” tab in the Products.
