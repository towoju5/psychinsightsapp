          By way of operations and use, we collect and process personal information so

          address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating
          system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, or

          • Through your IP address: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique
          identifier that electronic devices used to identify and communicate with

          automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP
          addresses for a variety of reasons, such as calculating usage levels,
          diagnosing server problems and administering the services.
          <br />
          • From your physical location: we may collect the physical location of your
          device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi signals.
          We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalised

          to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness
          of advertising campaigns. You may be able to allow or deny such uses and/or
          sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing
